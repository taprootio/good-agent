description: Turn a problem into a backlog story that a fresh implementer
  can work: review the problem against the codebase and the backlog, write
  the story with checkable acceptance criteria, review it internally until
  clean, review it externally with the other AI tool until clean, then
  finalize it. Use when asked to write, draft or refine a task, story or
  ticket, or when a request is too large to start without one.

# Write a task

A story is the contract between the person who wants something and the
context that will build it, usually a fresh one. It is done when a reviewer
who did not write it finds nothing left to guess.

## 1. Review the problem

- Ground in the repository's canonical instruction file and the design or
  specification documents it names.
- Read the backlog: is this already a story, part of one, or blocked by
  one? Where the repository uses Trellis, that is the items under its
  backlog root (`trellis/` by default) and `depends_on`.
- Verify the premise against the code: do the files, APIs and commands the
  request names exist; is the request still the right thing to build.
- Note every decision the request leaves open. Take the recommended option
  for each and record it; ask the owner only for a choice that would change
  the design materially either way.

## 2. Write the story

In the repository's own format (Trellis: front matter with `id`, `title`,
`status`, `milestone`, `priority`, `effort`, `depends_on`, `summary`, then
the body). The body has:

- **Scope**: what is built, as checkable bullets, each naming the design
  section or document it comes from.
- **Acceptance**: how a reader proves it is done: commands, fixtures,
  outputs, exit codes. Nothing that needs the author's memory.
- **Notes**: decisions taken and rejected alternatives, with the reason.
- **Risks**: what could make this harder than it looks, and the
  mitigation.
- Dependencies and effort consistent with the backlog's vocabulary.

Write for a reader who has only these files. Name real paths and commands.
Keep the summary to one sentence a backlog table can show.

## 3. Review it

Run the `review-loop` skill on the story with the story prompt
(`references/review-story.md` in that skill):

1. Internally, in a fresh context, until the findings array is `[]`.
2. Externally, by the other AI tool, until `[]`, confirming each round's
   fixes internally.

Every blocker and warning is confirmed against the cited file before it is
fixed; nits are fixed by default. A finding that is wrong is rejected with
the reason recorded.

## 4. Finalize

- Put the story where the repository keeps tasks; with Trellis, under the
  backlog root's `active/`. Regenerate the backlog and run its check (the
  repository's `regenerate` and `check` seam points, read from the Loop
  contract table in the canonical file); without Trellis, record the task
  where this repository keeps tasks.
- Record the review rounds in the story's Notes or in the repository's
  review record: independence, rounds per loop, dispositions. No model or
  vendor names.
- Hand the story to the owner with the open decisions listed first.
