# good-agent: instruction files that every AI tool reads

Good tools make hard work easy. Bad tools make easy work hard. Keeping AI
tool instructions DRY is as important as keeping code DRY.

## The layout

1. **One canonical file, `AGENTS.md`.** Codex reads it natively (and only
   that name, plus `AGENTS.override.md`). Copilot reads `AGENTS.md`,
   `CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md`. Claude Code reads it when there is no
   `CLAUDE.md`, or through an import. No other name reaches all three.
2. **Thin tool files.** `CLAUDE.md` is `@AGENTS.md` plus Claude-only notes.
   `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is a pointer plus Copilot-only notes,
   because Copilot has no import on GitHub.com. Per-language
   `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files carry deltas behind an
   `applyTo` glob and never restate the canonical file.
3. **Long material in linked docs.** Runbooks, architecture and decision
   records live under `docs/` and are linked by path. A link costs no
   context until the tool opens it; an `@` import costs context every
   session, so `@` is for the canonical file only.
4. **Budgets differ per tool.** Codex: 32 KiB for the whole chain of
   `AGENTS.md` files from the repository root down to its working
   directory, cut mid-file with no warning. Claude Code: under 200 lines
   per file loaded at launch, imports included. Copilot: no documented
   limit.
5. **Nothing points at what is gone.** Links, imports, repo paths and npm
   scripts named in instruction files must exist.

## Set up a repo

1. Create `AGENTS.md`, or rename the existing canonical file to it.
2. Write `CLAUDE.md` with `@AGENTS.md` on its first line, then anything
   Claude-only (model and effort policy, Claude-specific tooling).
3. Write `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as three lines: Copilot has no
   import on GitHub.com, read `AGENTS.md` first, and the per-language files
   are reminders only.
4. For each language, add `.github/instructions/<lang>.instructions.md`
   with `applyTo: "**/*.<ext>"` front matter and only the deltas.
5. Move anything reference-shaped out of `AGENTS.md` into `docs/` and link
   it.
6. Run `npx good-agent check` and fix every error; read `npx good-agent
   inspect` to see what each tool loads.

## Write rules that survive

- One rule per bullet: the behaviour, the exception, and the check that
  enforces it when there is one.
- A delta file adds to the canonical file; it never restates it. Cross-
  reference the section instead ("in addition to AGENTS.md, Protobuf
  conventions: ...").
- Keep paths repository-relative and name scripts the way they are run.
- Put the rule where the tool will see it: a rule only Claude needs goes
  under the import in `CLAUDE.md`; a rule for `.proto` files goes in the
  proto delta file; everything else goes in `AGENTS.md`.

## Audit

The guard catches structure. The rest needs reading.

1. Run `npx good-agent check --json` and fix every error first.
2. For each delta file, for each rule, find the canonical section on the
   same topic and read both. If they disagree, the canonical file wins and
   the delta is rewritten as an addition or deleted. Worked example: a
   proto delta said every RPC carries a `google.api.http` annotation while
   `AGENTS.md` said internal RPCs must omit it; the delta was wrong.
3. For each command in the files, run it with `--help` or confirm the
   script exists in the right `package.json`.
4. Look for paraphrased duplicates (the same rule in different words)
   between files; keep one.
5. In Claude Code, also run `/doctor prompt-audit`, which checks Claude's
   own files for older-model phrasing, missing files and contradictions.
6. Report findings as a list with file, line and the proposed edit. Do not
   apply edits the owner has not seen.

## Fix recipes

Generated from the guard's rules by `scripts/sync-skill.mjs`; the same
text `good-agent explain <rule>` prints, which also lists the sources.

<!-- BEGIN RECIPES -->

### `canonical/detect` (error)

Every tool reads one file natively (Codex: AGENTS.md; Claude Code: CLAUDE.md, or AGENTS.md when
there is none; Copilot: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md). Without a canonical file the other
checks have nothing to compare against, and the tools each load something different.

Fix: Create AGENTS.md at the repository root, or set "canonical" in good-agent.config.json to the
file the other instruction files point at.

### `canonical/name` (warn)

Codex reads AGENTS.md (and AGENTS.override.md) and ignores every other name unless each user adds it
to project_doc_fallback_filenames in their own ~/.codex/config.toml. Copilot reads AGENTS.md,
CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md. Claude Code reads AGENTS.md when there is no CLAUDE.md, or whatever
CLAUDE.md imports. AGENTS.md is the only name all three reach.

Fix: Rename the canonical file to AGENTS.md and keep CLAUDE.md as a file whose first line is
@AGENTS.md.

### `codex/size-budget` (error)

Codex concatenates AGENTS.md files from the repository root down to its working directory and stops
adding bytes at project_doc_max_bytes (32 KiB by default). The limit is one budget for the whole
chain, not per file: the file that crosses it is cut mid-file and everything after it never reaches
Codex. No warning is shown to the user. Per directory Codex takes the first file that exists,
AGENTS.override.md before AGENTS.md; an empty one still wins its directory. User-configured
project_doc_fallback_filenames live in each user's ~/.codex/config.toml, so this version does not
model them.

Fix: Move long sections into docs/ and link them from AGENTS.md, or split guidance into nested
AGENTS.md files closer to the code they govern. Raising project_doc_max_bytes is per-user config and
does not fix the repository.

### `claude/import-canonical` (error)

Claude Code loads another file at launch only through an @path import. A Markdown link or a sentence
saying "read AGENTS.md" is followed only if Claude decides to open the file, so the canonical
guidance is not reliably in context. When there is no CLAUDE.md at all, Claude Code 2.1.277 and
later read AGENTS.md directly; older versions load nothing, and no version reads a canonical file
with any other name on its own.

Fix: Make the first line of CLAUDE.md an import of the canonical file, for example @AGENTS.md, and
keep Claude-only notes below it.

### `claude/import-depth` (warn)

Imported files can import other files, but only to a maximum depth of four hops. An import past that
depth is silently not loaded.

Fix: Flatten the chain: import the deep file from CLAUDE.md directly, or link it by path instead of
importing it.

### `claude/size` (warn)

The Claude Code docs recommend keeping each CLAUDE.md file under 200 lines: longer files consume
more context and reduce adherence. Imported files load together with the file that imports them, so
they count the same way. Claude Code itself warns at startup when an instruction file is over the
recommended length, and when files together pass an undocumented combined limit.

Fix: Move reference material into docs/ linked by path (not @-imported), or into skills and
path-scoped .claude/rules that load on demand.

### `links/broken` (error)

An instruction file that links to a document that no longer exists sends the AI tool to nothing, and
an @import of a missing file makes Claude Code silently load nothing for it. Links resolve relative
to the file that holds them (a leading / means the repository root); imports resolve relative to the
importing file, as the Claude Code docs say.

Fix: Fix the path, or remove the link or import.

### `copilot/applyto` (error)

A path-specific instruction file (.github/instructions/NAME.instructions.md) is attached only to
requests whose files match its applyTo glob, declared in a front matter block at the top of the
file. Without applyTo, Copilot never attaches the file. excludeAgent, when present, must be
code-review or cloud-agent.

Fix: Start the file with a front matter block:
```
---
applyTo: "**/*.ts"
---
```

### `dry/copied-canonical` (error)

A tool file that copies the canonical file instead of importing or pointing to it is a second copy
that drifts the moment either is edited. Claude Code can import the canonical file with @path;
Copilot reads AGENTS.md natively; neither needs a copy.

Fix: Replace the copy with @<canonical> (Claude Code) or a short pointer (Copilot), and keep only
tool-specific notes in the tool file.
<!-- END RECIPES -->

## Do not

- Copy the canonical file into a tool file. Import it or point at it.
- Raise a tool's limit in user config as the fix for a repository problem.
- Link with `@` to anything but the canonical file.
- Hand-edit another tool's generated block (for example Trellis's). The
  `GOOD-AGENT` block is the one place for good-agent's own review policy.
- Call the things that read these files agents, assistants or helpers in
  prose. They are AI tools.
