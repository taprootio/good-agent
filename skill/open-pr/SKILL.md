# Open a pull request

A merge can be a release. In a repository where the version bump on the
base branch is the release, a pull request that changes shipped behaviour
and leaves the version alone merges quietly and releases nothing, and
nobody notices until someone asks where the fix is. This skill makes the
question part of opening every pull request. It never pushes or opens
anything without the owner's go-ahead.

Read the values from the repository's canonical instruction file, as the
other skills do: the `gates`, `branch-naming` and `attribution` seam points
of its Loop contract table when it has one, otherwise whatever the file
says in prose. Where the file is silent, use the defaults below and say so.

## 1. Confirm the branch and the gates

- `git status --short` is empty; unrelated changes in the tree are a
  blocker to surface, never something to commit into this branch.
- The branch is on top of the base branch. `<base>` in this skill is the
  base branch's remote-tracking ref (`origin/main`, say), never the local
  branch, which can be stale: `git fetch` the remote, then
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <base> HEAD` succeeds. When it does not,
  bring the branch up to date the way the repository does (a merge or a
  rebase, as its instruction file says), resolve conflicts, and rerun the
  gates. Do not push to do this.
- Conflict resolution, a bump and a changelog edit all change the reviewed
  tree. Once the release decision in section 2 is made and every edit is
  committed, run the repository's review loop on the final diff again (the
  `review-loop` skill: internally until clean, then externally until clean,
  as its review policy says) and update the task's review record, before
  the pull request is opened. Run it once, at that point, not after each
  edit: the diff review flags a changed behaviour with no bump and no
  explanation, so a review before the decision cannot come back clean. Put
  the decision where the reviewer reads it (the task's Notes or the
  changelog). The delta is small, so the round is cheap; skipping it ships
  code that no reviewer read.
- The gates the repository names have passed on the final tree: the
  `gates` seam point, or the commands its canonical file lists. If any
  file changed after they last ran, run them again. A gate that fails is
  reported, not skipped.

## 2. Decide whether this pull request needs a version bump

Skip this step, and say in the PR body that the repository has no release
flow, when nothing in the repository publishes: no release workflow, no
version the instruction file or design documents tie to a merge. The
signals are a release workflow under `.github/workflows/`, a `publish`
script, a changelog with version headings, and a version field in a
package manifest.

- **Find the manifest.** The package manifest is `package.json` in a Node
  package, and the equivalent where the repository's release flow reads
  its version (`pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml` and so on). Take the one the
  release workflow reads. A repository with no manifest has no version to
  bump: do the changelog check below, report the absence in the PR body and
  go on. A repository with several manifests (a monorepo or a workspace)
  needs the manifest of each package the diff touches; when the
  repository's rules do not say which versions move together, ask the
  owner.
- **Compare the version.** Read the version on the branch and on the base
  (`git show <base>:package.json`). If they differ, the branch already
  bumps it. Check the whole release state: the new version is the bump the
  rules in **Bump rules** below give; the changelog has a dated heading for
  it that holds the entries for this release, with none of them left under
  `Unreleased`; and every status line that names the version is updated.
  Fix what is missing as in the **Yes** case below, then go on to section 3.
- **Look at what the diff touches.** `git diff --name-status <base>...HEAD`
  against what the package publishes: the manifest's `files` list, its
  `bin` and `exports` entries, and the directories they name (in
  good-agent: `src/`, `scripts/`, `skill/`, `schema/`; `alias/` is a
  separate package with its own manifest). Also look
  for entries added under the changelog's `Unreleased` heading. Shipped
  behaviour changed when the diff touches published files in a way a
  consumer of the package can observe: code, a rule or its limit, the
  shipped skills and their prompts, a schema, a CLI flag or output. Tests,
  internal docs, the backlog and CI-only changes do not.
- **Changelog check.** A change to shipped behaviour with no `Unreleased`
  entry gets one, in the repository's changelog format, committed on the
  branch, with the applicable gates run again. This holds whether or not
  the pull request turns out to be a release.
- **Already decided.** When the task or the changelog already records the
  decision (a work-task run settles it before its diff review), check it
  still matches the diff and go on; do not ask again.
- **Stop and ask.** When shipped behaviour changed (or `Unreleased` gained
  entries) and the version did not move, do not guess and do not bump on
  your own. Ask the owner, once and plainly: "This changes shipped
  behaviour and the version is still `<x>`. Is this pull request the
  release?" Offer the bump the repository's rules give. Whether a merge is
  a release is the owner's decision.
  - **Yes.** Make the bump in the manifest, and in its lockfile if the
    repository keeps one (`npm version <x> --no-git-tag-version` does both
    for npm). Move the `Unreleased` entries under a new heading for the
    version with today's date, leaving an empty `Unreleased` heading above
    it if the changelog keeps one. Update any status line that names the
    version (a README install line, a version line in the design document,
    a pinned `npx <name>@<minor>` in the docs). Commit the bump as its own
    commit and rerun the gates.
  - **No, deliberately not a release.** Record that in the PR body in a
    sentence: the version stays `<x>` and the changes wait under
    `Unreleased` for a later release. Note it in the task as well, where
    the reviewer reads it.

**Bump rules.** Use the repository's own, from its instruction file or the
design document it names. For good-agent (`docs/design.md` section 8): a
new rule or a changed limit is a minor, a rule rename or removal is a
major, everything else is a patch, and a behaviour change while the version
is still `0.x` is a minor. Where the repository states none, use semantic
versioning and say that you did.

## 3. Check the commits and the branch name

- Every commit on the branch since the base
  (`git log <base>..HEAD --format=%B`) follows the repository's
  `attribution` policy. For a repository that forbids attribution, no
  `Co-Authored-By:` trailers and no "Generated with" lines; for one that
  requires a trailer, every commit carries it. Fix a violation by
  rewording the commits on the unpushed branch, after telling the owner.
- The branch name follows the `branch-naming` seam point
  (Trellis: `<initials>/<id-lowercase>/<slug>`). A branch that does not
  match is reported to the owner, who decides whether to rename it;
  renaming is cheap before the push and awkward after.

## 4. Write the PR body

Use the repository's pull request template and the conventions in its
instruction file; where there are none, use the sections below, in plain
prose. A template does not drop what follows: fit the review record and
the release outcome into its sections, or add them under their own
headings. The title follows the repository's format (Trellis:
`<ID>: imperative summary`, at most 72 characters).

- **What changed.** The behaviour a reader gets, not the file list. Name the
  task or issue id.
- **Gates.** The commands run and that they passed on the final tree.
- **Review.** The rounds and dispositions the task's closeout records:
  independence, the number of rounds internally and externally, what was
  fixed, rejected or waived and by whom. No model or vendor names.
- **What the merge does.** Say whether merging releases. For a release,
  what the release workflow will do on the base branch: which version it
  publishes, the dist-tag, the tag and release it creates. For a pull
  request that is deliberately not a release, say so and where the changes
  wait.
- **For the owner.** Anything left undone, a decision taken on their
  behalf, and what needs their hand after the merge.

The repository's `attribution` policy applies to the body as it does to the
commits.

## 5. Open it, after approval

Confirm `git status --short` is empty (every edit from the steps above is
committed) and that the review loop has been run on the final diff if any
commit was made in sections 1 to 4 (section 1 says when), then show the owner the branch, its head, the bump decision and
the drafted title and body. Pushing and opening are the owner's go-ahead, in this
conversation, for this pull request; an approval for an earlier push does
not carry over. After the go-ahead, push the branch, open the pull request
against the base branch with the host's tool (`gh pr create --base
<base-branch> --title ... --body-file ...` on GitHub, where `<base-branch>`
is `<base>` without the remote prefix, such as `main`), and report the link. If the
repository's host or tool is unknown, give the owner the drafted title and
body and stop.
